# Rassid — Flight Tracking Platform

## Project Description
Rassid is a platform designed to enhance the passenger travel experience by providing accurate and real‑time flight information.  
It delivers complete details for passengers from the moment a flight arrives at the airport until departure, including gate updates, boarding times, and instant notifications.

## Problem
Passengers face several issues at airports:
- No unified platform showing gate information and its location.
- Gate changes occur without prior notice.
- Passengers must frequently check airport screens manually.
- Time is wasted searching for the latest updates.
- Difficulty locating the gate inside the airport.

## Solution
Rassid provides a unified system that includes:
- Public flight listings for every airport.
- Private tracking links for passengers.
- Tools for airports to add gate and boarding information.
- Instant SMS/Email notifications for any updates.
- A simple map showing the gate location inside the airport.

## Key Features
- Public access to flight listings without login.
- Private and accurate tracking for each passenger.
- SMS & Email alerts for updates.
- Gate map & navigation.
- Full airport staff management tools.
